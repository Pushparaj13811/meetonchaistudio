## LinkedIn About Section

### Version A: Direct & Confident (RECOMMENDED)

```
We build digital products that don't just launch—they scale.

MeetOnChai Studio is a software development team that helps founders and
businesses turn ideas into products people actually use. No fluff. No
over-promising. Just honest code and real results.

🎯 WHAT WE DO

• MVP Development – From concept to paying customers in 6-8 weeks
• AI Integration – Practical AI that adds measurable value (not just buzzwords)
• Web & Mobile Apps – Fast, secure, scalable applications
• Internal Tools – Custom solutions that save your team 20+ hours/week
• UI/UX Design – Interfaces that users love and businesses trust

🏆 WHY CLIENTS CHOOSE US

Most agencies promise the moon and deliver PowerPoints. We're different:

✓ Honest timelines – If it takes 8 weeks, we say 8 weeks (not 3)
✓ Products that scale – Built for 1K users today, ready for 100K tomorrow
✓ Tech that makes sense – We choose the right stack, not the trendy one
✓ Your success is ours – We don't disappear after launch

📊 BY THE NUMBERS

• 50+ products shipped
• 8-week average MVP timeline
• Clients in 12+ countries
• 95% client satisfaction rate

🌍 WHO WE WORK WITH

Startups needing MVPs that survive real users. Growing companies needing
internal tools that actually work. Traditional businesses adding AI without
the hype. Anyone who values honest partnerships over sales pitches.

💬 LET'S TALK

```

### Version B: Story-Driven (ALTERNATIVE)

```
Born from late-night debugging sessions and way too much chai ☕

MeetOnChai Studio started because we were tired of seeing great ideas die
from bad execution. We've been on both sides—building products that failed
and products that scaled to millions of users. We learned what works.

Now we help founders and businesses build digital products the right way:
fast enough to test the market, solid enough to scale when it works.

🛠️ OUR SERVICES

We don't do everything. We do these things really well:

→ SaaS MVPs that reach product-market fit
→ AI features that solve real problems (not just LLM wrappers)
→ Mobile apps that feel native, perform fast
→ Internal tools that eliminate manual work
→ UI/UX that converts visitors to customers

📈 OUR APPROACH

1. Honest scoping – We tell you what's realistic
2. Iterative building – Ship fast, learn, improve
3. Quality code – No shortcuts that cost you later
4. Your success – We measure by your metrics, not our hours

We're the team you call when you need it done right the first time, or when
someone else already did it wrong.

🌏 BASED IN INDIA/NEPAL • SERVING CLIENTS GLOBALLY

From San Francisco to Singapore, we've helped startups launch, scale, and succeed.

## First Week LinkedIn Posts

### MONDAY - Industry Insight (Carousel)

**Format:** 10-slide carousel

**Slide 1 (Cover):**
```
Why 67% of MVPs
Fail in 6 Months

(And how to be in the 33%)

👉 Swipe for the 5 mistakes
```

**Slide 2:**
```
MISTAKE #1

Building for "everyone"

❌ "We're like Uber, but for everything"

✅ "We help freelance designers find
   clients in 48 hours"

Niche wins. Always.
```

**Slide 3:**
```
MISTAKE #2

Waiting for "perfect"

Your MVP in 6 months:
→ Over-engineered
→ Outdated assumptions
→ No users yet

Ship in 6 WEEKS instead:
→ Test real assumptions
→ Get real feedback
→ Iterate fast
```

**Slide 4:**
```
MISTAKE #3

Wrong tech stack

Don't choose tech because:
❌ It's trending on Twitter
❌ Your friend uses it
❌ It looks good on your resume

Choose because:
✅ Your team knows it
✅ It scales to your needs
✅ It has good support
```

**Slide 5:**
```
MISTAKE #4

Ignoring performance

"We'll optimize later"

Later never comes.

Slow apps lose users:
• 1 second delay = 7% fewer conversions
• 3+ seconds = 53% bounce rate

Build fast from day 1.
```

**Slide 6:**
```
MISTAKE #5

No feedback loops

Launch ≠ Done

The real work starts after launch:
→ User interviews
→ Analytics review
→ Iterate based on data

MVPs that succeed adapt quickly.
```

**Slide 7:**
```
WHAT WORKS INSTEAD

Our 6-Week MVP Framework:

Week 1-2: Core feature only
Week 3-4: Polish & testing
Week 5: Beta launch
Week 6: Iterate on feedback

Shipped. Learning. Improving.
```

**Slide 8:**
```
REAL EXAMPLE

Client: SaaS for remote teams
Timeline: 6 weeks
Launch: 50 beta users
Month 3: 1,200 users
Month 6: $15K MRR

Because we shipped fast,
learned fast, iterated fast.
```

**Slide 9:**
```
THE BOTTOM LINE

Perfect MVPs don't exist.

Successful MVPs:
→ Solve 1 problem really well
→ Ship in weeks, not months
→ Learn from real users
→ Iterate relentlessly

That's the 33%.
```

67% of MVPs fail within 6 months.

After building 50+ products, we've seen the same 5 mistakes kill great ideas.

### TUESDAY - Proud Moment

**Post:**
```
Friday 4:47 PM. Production was down.

Our client's checkout stopped working. Black Friday traffic.
Every minute = thousands in lost revenue.

Rajesh (our backend lead) was supposed to be off for the weekend.

Instead, he:
→ Jumped on the call in 8 minutes
→ Identified the issue (payment gateway API change)
→ Deployed a fix in 47 minutes
→ Stayed online until traffic normalized

Client saved an estimated $45K in sales that evening.

Rajesh's reaction when we thanked him?
"That's what we do. Now pass the chai ☕"

---

This is why we don't just write code—we partner.

When your product is down, we're not "checking our SLA."
We're fixing it.

Building products isn't 9-5. Neither are we.

#TeamCulture #ClientSuccess #ProductionSupport #TechTeam

---

P.S. Yes, we bought Rajesh dinner that weekend. And no, we don't
expect this to be the norm—but we're proud to work with people
who care this much.
```

---

### WEDNESDAY - Industry Insight

**Post:**
```
"Can you add AI to our product?"

We get this question 3x per week now.

Our answer: Maybe. But probably not where you think.

Here's the reality check nobody's giving you:

❌ WHEN AI IS THE WRONG ANSWER

• Your core product doesn't work yet
  (Fix that first)

• You want it "because everyone's doing it"
  (Worst reason ever)

• You can't explain WHY users need it
  (They probably don't)

• It's a solution looking for a problem
  (Backwards)

✅ WHEN AI ACTUALLY ADDS VALUE

• Reduces manual work (support tickets → chatbot)
• Personalizes at scale (1,000 users, 1,000 experiences)
• Analyzes patterns humans can't (fraud detection, recommendations)
• Speeds up tedious tasks (content drafts, data entry)

🎯 THE QUESTIONS WE ASK FIRST

1. What manual process takes your team hours?
2. What do users ask for that you can't scale?
3. Where's the repetitive work that's costing money?
4. What data do you have that you're not using?

If AI solves one of those → Yes, let's build it.
If not → Save your budget.

---

Real example from last month:

Client: "We want AI product descriptions"
Us: "Why?"
Client: "Competitors have it"
Us: "Are your current descriptions the problem?"
Client: "...no, conversion is actually fine"
Us: "Then let's fix [actual problem] instead"

We built a different feature. Conversion up 23%.
No AI needed.

---

AI isn't magic. It's a tool.

Use it when it solves a real problem.
Ignore the hype when it doesn't.

### THURSDAY - Behind-the-Scenes

**Post:**
```
Our "Chai & Code" Friday tradition 🧑‍💻☕

Every Friday at 4 PM, we stop coding.

Not for a meeting. Not for a demo. For chai and conversations.

What we talk about:
→ The bug that haunted us all week
→ A clever solution someone found
→ New tools we're experimenting with
→ Non-work stuff (yes, we're humans too)

Why we do this:

After building 50+ projects, we learned something:

The best code doesn't come from people grinding 80-hour weeks.

It comes from teams that:
• Share knowledge freely
• Celebrate small wins
• Learn from each other
• Actually enjoy the work

Burnt-out developers write buggy code.
Energized teams ship great products.

---

This week's highlight:

Priya (our frontend dev) showed us a React optimization
that cut our client's page load time by 1.2 seconds.

It took her 3 hours to figure out. Took 15 minutes to
implement. Will save users thousands of hours of loading time.

That's the kind of knowledge sharing that happens over chai.

P.S. We're curious—what traditions does your team have?
Coffee breaks? Lunch & learns? Nothing?

Share below 👇 (Stealing good ideas for our team is encouraged 😄)

→ You're technical but need a second opinion
→ You started building but feel stuck

## Cold Email Templates

### Template 1: SaaS Founders

**Subject:** Quick question about [Their Product Name]

```
Hi [First Name],

I saw [Their Product] on Product Hunt yesterday—congrats on the launch!

[Specific observation about their product that shows you actually looked at it.
Example: "The way you've simplified invoice automation is clever—most tools
overcomplicate it."]

Quick question: Are you handling the development in-house, or working with
a dev partner?

Asking because we work with early-stage SaaS founders helping them ship
MVPs in 6-8 weeks (and scale them when they work).

For example, we recently helped [Similar Company] go from idea to 1,200
paying users in 4 months. [Link to case study if you have one]

Worth a quick chat? No sales pitch—just curious if we could help with
[specific technical challenge you noticed].

Best,
[Your Name]
Founder, MeetOnChai Studio
meetonchai.com

P.S. Even if you're all set on dev, happy to share what we learned about
[relevant topic]. Always happy to help founders.
```

---

### Template 2: Companies Posting Jobs

**Subject:** Alternative to hiring full-time [Role]

```
Hi [First Name],

Saw your posting for a [Role] on [Platform].

Not applying for the role (we're a dev studio, not freelancers), but wanted
to reach out because we solve this problem differently for companies like yours.

Instead of hiring 1-2 developers at $120K/year each, we become your extended
team:

→ Full dev team (frontend, backend, design, QA)
→ Start next week (no 3-month hiring process)
→ Scale up/down based on your needs
→ ~40% cost savings vs. US-based full-time

We work with [similar companies] on:
• MVP development
• Product feature builds
• Technical debt cleanup
• Scaling infrastructure

Recent example: [Client] needed to ship [feature] in 6 weeks. Their hiring
process was taking 2+ months. We started in 5 days, delivered in 5 weeks.

Worth exploring if this model might work better than hiring?

15-minute call to see if it makes sense for [Their Company]?

Best,
[Your Name]
MeetOnChai Studio
hello@meetonchai.com

P.S. If you're committed to the full-time hire, totally understand. But even
for short-term gaps (while you hire), we can help bridge the time.
```

---

### Template 3: Traditional Businesses (AI Angle)

**Subject:** AI for [Their Industry] that actually works

```
Hi [First Name],

I've been researching AI adoption in [their industry] and noticed
[Their Company] is [specific observation].

Most AI vendors are selling hype. We build stuff that actually works.

For [similar company in their industry], we built an AI chatbot that now handles
60% of support tickets—saving their team ~15 hours/week and improving response
times from 4 hours to 4 minutes.

ROI was positive in month 2.

I'm curious: What manual process is taking your team the most time right now?
• Customer support?
• Data entry/processing?
• Scheduling/logistics?
• Something else?

If AI can solve it, we'll tell you exactly how.
If it can't, we'll tell you that too (and what will actually work).

Worth a quick 15-minute chat to explore?

Best,
[Your Name]
MeetOnChai Studio
meetonchai.com

P.S. We're not a "LLM wrapper" startup. We've been building software for
[X years], and AI is just one tool in the toolkit. We use it when it makes sense.
```

---

### Template 4: Follow-Up (5-7 Days Later)

**Subject:** Re: [Original Subject]

```
Hi [First Name],

Following up on my email from last week about [topic].

I know you're busy (founders/CTOs get 100+ emails/day), so I'll keep this short:

We help [their type of company] with [specific outcome]:

→ [Company 1]: MVP in 6 weeks → 2K users in month 1
→ [Company 2]: AI feature added → 40% less support workload
→ [Company 3]: Internal tool built → 20 hrs/week saved

If any of that is relevant to [Their Company], let's talk.

If not, no worries—happy to stay connected on LinkedIn for when timing's better.

Best,
[Your Name]

P.S. If you know someone else who might need this, I'd appreciate the intro.
Happy to make it worth your time 😊
```

---

### Template 5: Client Referral Request

**Subject:** Quick favor?

```
Hi [Client Name],

Hope [their project] is going well! Saw you hit [milestone] last week—congrats!

Quick ask: Do you know any founders/CTOs who might need development help?

We're opening slots for Q2 and thought I'd ask if anyone in your network
might be a fit.

Specifically looking for:
→ SaaS companies needing MVPs
→ Growing startups adding AI features
→ Businesses building internal tools

If you refer someone who becomes a client, we'll give you both:
• $1,000 service credit for you
• $500 off their first project for them

Even if they don't become a client, happy to do a free consultation for
anyone you recommend.

Any names come to mind?

Thanks!
[Your Name]

P.S. No pressure at all—just thought I'd ask since we did great work together 😊
```
